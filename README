# About
The purpose of this application is to demonstrate cracking and decrypting ciphertexts encrypted with the same key when using the one time pad. The one time pad is perfectly secret when the key is only used once. This shows what can be done when the same key is used multiple times.

# Objective
There are 7 ciphertexts, each of which was generated by encrypting some 31-character ASCII plaintext with the one-time pad using the same key. Decrypt them and recover all 7 plaintexts, each of which is a grammatically correct English sentence.
